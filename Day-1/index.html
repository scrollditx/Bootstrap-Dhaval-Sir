<!--! About Bootstrap:-  -->

<!--* Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides a set of pre-designed UI components, layouts, and utilities that can be used to create responsive web pages and web applications. It is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is easy to use and customize. Bootstrap is designed to be mobile-first, meaning that it is optimized for mobile devices and responsive design. It is also modular and extensible, allowing developers to pick and choose the components they need and customize them to fit their needs. -->

<!--* Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. -->

<!--* Bootstrap was released as open-source in August 2011 on GitHub. In June 2014, it was the No.1 project on GitHub. -->

<!--! Libraries Used Before Bootstrap:- -->

<!--? JQuery UI, YUI, Blueprint, and Mocha were some of the libraries used before Bootstrap. -->

<!--! About Bootstrap's CDN link:-  -->

<!--* <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/> -->

<!--? This <link> tag includes the Bootstrap CSS file from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). -->

<!--! About Bootstrap's Script tag:- -->

<!--* This <script> tag includes the Bootstrap JavaScript file from a CDN. The bootstrap.bundle.min.js file includes both Bootstrap's JavaScript and Popper.js, which is required for some Bootstrap components like tooltips and popovers. -->

<!--! About Popper.js:- -->

<!--? Poppers.js is a JavaScript library used to create popovers, tooltips, and other interactive elements. It is a dependency of Bootstrap and is included in the bootstrap.bundle.min.js file. Poppers.js is used to position and animate the popovers and tooltips, making them appear and disappear smoothly. -->

<!--! About my used classes:- -->

<!--? 1. container: This class is used to create a container element that can be used to wrap other elements on the page. It provides a fixed-width container that centers the content and adds padding on the sides. -->

<!--* 2. row: This class is used to create a row element that can be used to group columns together. It provides a horizontal grouping of columns and adds margin to separate them. -->

<!--? 3. col: This class is used to create a column element that can be used to define the layout of content within a row. It provides a responsive grid system that adjusts the width of columns based on the screen size. -->

<!--* 4. bg-dark, bg-success, bg-secondary, bg-warning, bg-danger, bg-info: These classes are used to set the background color of the elements. They provide predefined background colors that can be applied to different sections of the page. -->

<!--! bg-secondary: Light gray background -->

<!--! bg-danger: Red background -->
<!--! bg-warning: Yellow background -->
<!--! bg-info: Light blue background -->
<!--! bg-light: Light background -->
<!--! bg-dark: Dark background -->
<!--! bg-white: White background -->
<!--! bg-transparent: Transparent background -->

<!--? 5. text-white, text-center, text-dark: These classes are used to set the text color and alignment of the elements. They provide predefined text colors and alignment options that can be applied to different sections of the page. -->

<!--* 6. py-4, py-3: These classes are used to set the padding (vertically) of the elements. They provide predefined padding values that can be applied to different sections of the page. -->

<!--! About Relative Units:- -->

<!--? 1. rem: This unit is relative to the root element (html). It is used to set the font size of the elements based on the root element's font size. -->

<!--* 2. em: This unit is relative to the parent element's font size. It is used to set the font size of the elements based on the parent element's font size. -->
